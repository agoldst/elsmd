"""overlay_filter

Simplistic pandoc filter to include beamer overlay specifications on
inline tex in markdown

Whereas in normal beamer LaTeX you'd write

    \cmd<overlay>{...}

in markdown write

    \cmd{<overlay>}{...}

then process with

    pandoc --filter overlay_filter

Environments are passed through to LaTeX, so there's no need to filter
them; write onlyenv as normal, for example.

The code for walking the tree in 'walk' and the main block is taken from
the pandocfilters python module, https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters,
(C) 2013 John MacFarlane. This way we do not require the user's system's
python to have pandocfilters installed, though, of course, I have to
remember to keep up with changes in pandoc's JSON API. The present
script should be compatible with pandoc versions on both sides of the
pandoc 1.18 JSON format change (AG scripsit, December 2016).
