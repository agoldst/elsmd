"""overlay_filter

Simplistic pandoc filter to include beamer overlay specifications on
inline tex in markdown

Whereas in normal beamer LaTeX you'd write

    \cmd<overlay>{...}

in markdown write

    \cmd{<overlay>}{...}

then process with

    pandoc --filter overlay_filter

Environments are passed through to LaTeX, so there's no need to filter
them; write onlyenv as normal, for example.

The code for walking the tree in 'walk' and the main block is taken from
the pandocfilters python module, https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters,
(C) 2013 John MacFarlane. (This way we do not require the user's
system's python to have pandocfilters installed.)
