" beamer's \note{} command body can be multiline LaTeX
" This is not syntactically proper since there is no rule that says that a }

syn region beamernote matchgroup=Delimiter start="^\\note{" end="^}" contains=@texCmdGroup keepend

syn region nativediv matchgroup=Delimeter start="^:::" end="^:::" contains=ALLBUT,nativediv
